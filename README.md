# badger2040-scripts
Personal code examples that can be run on a Pimoroni Badger2040

For more information about the Badger2040 and the Badger2040w, visit their website: https://pimoroni.com/badger2040

They may also be able to be run on a badger2040w but I don't currently own one, so feel free to try at your own risk.
