This badge.py script extends the example badge script by adding the ability to have multiple badge profiles.

Simply upload a `badge-profile.txt` file and a matching `badge-profile.jpg` or `badge-profile.png` image file to the `/badges/` directory and then you'll be able to scroll through them on the badger2040.

See the badges folder for examples.
